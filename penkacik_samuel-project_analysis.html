			<h1>Project Analysis</h1>

			<h2>Site Intent</h2>
			<p>The site I chose to work on is Theatre Downtown. Theatre Downtown's website is currently lacking in aesthetic appeal and information architecture. The site's primary purpose is to get the user to come and see the shows playing at the theatre by informing them on the what and when of the performances. The site also has such secondary goals as: providing information on the theatre itself to get users to visit, telling performers how and when they can audition, encouraging users to make a contribution to the theatre, getting the user to join the mailing list, and giving the user directions to the theatre's location. The information is already there, it just needs to be condensed, organized and placed on a clean and attractive page.</p>
			<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
			<p>Theatre Downtown's local competition is currently winning in the website arena. Other local theatres such as the Orlando Shakespeare Theatre have sites that look significantly more professional and are much easier to use, with well designed information architecture. Their downfall, though, is that they have not been well optimized for search engines. For example, their site title says "Welcome!" which does not give any information about the page. Also, the URL could also be better, it is currently, "orlandoshakes.com", which is more befitting of an Orlando based milkshake stand than a theatre. I believe that with some well thought out SEO, Theatre Downtown's site could find a spot on the first page of a Google search. Combine that with a well designed website and Theatre Downtown will have a definite edge over its competitors.</p>
			<h2>Targeted Audience</h2>
			<p>According to Alexa.com, the website for an Orlando-based Shakespeare Theatre is visited primarily by Women between the ages of 45 and 54 who do not have children, and secondarily by women between the ages of 18 and 24. While there is a deficit in visitors between the ages of 25 and 34. The bounce rate for visitors to this website is 58% (meaning that 58% of users only visit one page before leaving the site). This tells us that we should make sure to have the most important information on the Theatre Downtown site be very eye catching and on the homepage, especially since the average pageview duration is only 45 seconds.</p>
